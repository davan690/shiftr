One option for editting package content and meta-data associated with R packages are vignettes. These are "long form" documentation of the functions and data associated with the package you are building. 

This is a simple demo on how vignettes work with traditional and current R package building tools such as reoxygen2 and devtools.

## Overview

For a vignette to work with the functionality of an R package a `./vignettes/` folder needed to be created for each of the vignettes. 

RMarkdown files can then be added to this folder with the following `yaml` header:

```
---
title: your title
output: vignette::
---
```

The advantage of this is that the associated code chunks of the RMDs in the vignettes folder are all associated with the Package inforstructure that you have build iyour R functions around.

```

```
